                WebTools Installer for Synology

Release Notes:
----------------

Ver 1.3  - 29 April 2016

   - Fixes:

     issue: GHI #14    - Could not start.   Caused by DSM 6.0 update installer changes.  
     issue: <internal> - Count not uninstall if package damaged / removed from Plex
     issue: <internal> - DSM 6.0 firewall definition management cleaner
     issue:            - WebTools would 'install' but fail to place WebTools.bundle 
                         in Plex Plug-ins directory (download failure)
     issue:            - Uninstalling WebTools from Package Center left WebTools in Plex.
                         Changed to be 'Synology style' removal which is 'complete'.

   - Installation changes;

     1.  WebTools must have an active internet connection to complete the 
         installation/upgrade and download the latest version of WebTools core modules

   - Limitations:

     1.  Occasionally Package Center sits and spins after installation complete.
         Refreshing your browser window and opening Package Center
         should show it's already installed.  If not,  Restart DSM.

         This is due to Synology UI  - Browser interaction.  


   - Improvements:

     1.  Upgrade/update to current version without uninstalling first.
         Caution:  Will force-upgrade WebTools utility in Plex (settings not altered)


     2.  Downloading WebTools from GitHub more tolerant of network delay.  
         Will retry 3 times (20 seconds each) before installation abort.

         Package Center will show 'installing' during this time.  It will report
         final status upon completion.

     3.  WebTools.log contains more descriptive error messages


   - Tested and verified on:

     1.  DSM 5.2-5644 Update 5
     2.  DSM 6.0-7321 Update 3
