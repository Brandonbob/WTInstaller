Release Notes:
----------------

Ver 1.3  - 27 April 2016

   - Fixes:

     issue: GHI #14    - Could not start.   Caused by DSM 6.0 update installer changes.  
     issue: <internal> - Count not uninstall if package damaged / removed from Plex
     issue: <internal> - DSM 6.0 firewall definition management cleaner
     issue:            - WebTools would 'install' but fail to place WebTools.bundle 
                         in Plex Plug-ins directory (download failure)
     issue:            - Uninstalling WebTools from Package Center left WebTools in Plex.
                         Changed to be 'Synology style' removal which is 'complete'.

     1.  WebTools must have an active internet connection to complete the 
         installation/upgrade and download the latest version of WebTools core modules
